# Welcome to *api-bean-to-brew* --- 🫘 Bean to Brew ☕️

This code is from my final project during my Java bootcamp in summer 2023.

I created this API to store user information, as well as trivia questions and level data for my game.
The answers to those trivia questions is received by this backend from my frontend and then checked by chatgpt-3 via prompt. 

You can play the game here: https://bean-to-brew.bulbt.com/
